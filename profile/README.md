# Welcome to the Shen Lab at NYU Grossman School of Medicine

We are a research group led by Dr. Yiqiu Shen, Assistant Professor in the Department of Radiology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Our mission is to develop label-efficient and explainable deep learning models for medical imaging to enhance clinical workflows and improve patient care.

## üî¨ Research Focus

Our research interests include:

- **Multimodal Learning**: Integrating diverse data modalities (e.g., imaging, text, tabular, sequential data) to inform clinical decisions more effectively.
- **Explainable AI**: Designing computer-aided diagnosis systems that can articulate their reasoning in a human-understandable manner.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Exploring optimal strategies for presenting AI-generated diagnoses to clinicians to foster effective collaboration and maximize patient outcomes.
